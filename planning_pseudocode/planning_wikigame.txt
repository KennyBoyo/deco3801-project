wiki game planning

generate topics:
# need to decide how topics are generated: will it be from preexisting articles, new topics or a mixture of both?
# preexisting: potentially limited selection to begin with, will need a substatial user base to create unique games
# new topics: poses a new problem of making up topics (maybe we could use gpt3?)
# mixture: could be ideal, saves resources generating new topics each time by including existing topics already

the site itself:
# home screen with start game button
#   - maybe have a button for just browsing the wiki?
#   - needs a timer persistent across articles while within a game
#   - needs a counter for articles passed through
#   - leaderboard ? hard to quantify when people get different topics
#        - multiplayer aspect may be complicated to implement
#        - could be done by having the same pair of topics for a given day/time frame? so leaderboard per topic pair

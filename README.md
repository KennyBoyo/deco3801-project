This is the repository contains code to launch your own instance of mediawiki on AWS.

To start, use `yarn install` and `yarn deploy-data` to launch an instance of AWS EC2 and an SQL instance of AWS RDS ensure to configure your aws credentials before attempting this. Then when the AWS instances have been deployed, ssh into the EC2 instance, clone this repository, and run the `steps.sh` file in /src/scripts. This installs the necessary software within AWS EC2 such as NGINX, PHP, ImageMagick, Mariadb, and Mediawiki.

You now have a choice of whether to continue using the AWS RDS instance as the backend, or a local MariaDB instance set up within EC2. To configure them, enter the url of the EC2 instance into your web browser (which should look like "http://ec2-..."). This will lead to the mediawiki configuration page where the database can be set up.

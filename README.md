Welcome to ExpressedCode's project repository, Eric's branch

# About the project

AI Expressed is a game revolving around an online wikipedia generated entirely through prompts to the AI text generation model GPT3. The goal of the game is to navigate from a given start article to an end article by forging a path with newly generated intermediary articles. This is done by prompting GPT3 to generate a new article. However, the subject of the new article must exist in the current page's text. For example, being on the page for 'Dog' and trying to generate the page for 'China' will not work if 'China' is not present within the text. The game ends when the player reaches the end article.

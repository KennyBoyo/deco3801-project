Welcome to ExpressedCode's project repository

# About the project

AI Expressed is an online Wiki Game but with a twist: all the articles are generated by OpenAI's GPT-3 AI model. This project aims to explore the limits of AI text generation through a fun and interactive way by letting users generate Wikipedia articles on the fly as they try to reach a destination article.
